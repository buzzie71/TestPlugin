This TestPlugin contains a few features as part of a foray into plugin writing:

/buzzie - returns a text-only message to the sender.
/zap - Drops lightning on a player, killing them.
/spawn-tame-mob - Spawns in a tamed pet (ocelot or wolf) to a specified player, even if the player never logged in or is offline.

Right-clicking on a tamed ocelot or wolf will also give information on who owns the pet.
